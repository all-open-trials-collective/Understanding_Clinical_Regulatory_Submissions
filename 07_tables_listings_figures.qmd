# Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs)

## Introduction to TLFs in Regulatory Submissions

Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) represent the final output of the clinical data processing pipeline, serving as the primary means of presenting analysis results to regulatory authorities. This chapter explores the creation, validation, and regulatory requirements for TLFs using our demographics example.

## The Role of TLFs in Regulatory Documents

### Clinical Study Report (CSR) Integration
TLFs form the analytical backbone of the Clinical Study Report:

- **Summary tables**: Providing concise overviews of key findings
- **Detailed listings**: Offering comprehensive data transparency
- **Graphical displays**: Illustrating trends and relationships
- **Supporting appendices**: Documenting methodology and additional analyses

### Reviewer's Guide Context
TLFs must align with the Analysis Data Reviewer's Guide (ADRG):

- **Cross-referencing**: Linking outputs to source datasets and derivations
- **Methodology documentation**: Explaining analytical approaches
- **Interpretation guidance**: Providing context for regulatory review
- **Navigation aids**: Facilitating efficient reviewer workflow

## Programming TLFs for Data Presentation

### Demographics Table Example

Building on our demographic data journey, we examine the creation of a comprehensive demographics and baseline characteristics table:

**Table Structure:**
```
