# Creating SDTM Domains

## Introduction to SDTM Domain Creation

The Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) represents a critical standardization step in the journey from raw clinical trial data to regulatory submission. This chapter explores the process, rationale, and best practices for converting collected trial data into CDISC-compliant SDTM domains.

## Understanding the 'Why' of SDTM

### Regulatory Requirements
SDTM standardization serves multiple critical purposes:

- **Regulatory harmonization**: Enabling consistent review processes across global health authorities
- **Data transparency**: Providing clear, standardized data structures for regulatory reviewers
- **Submission efficiency**: Streamlining the review process through predictable data formats
- **Data integrity**: Ensuring traceability and auditability of clinical trial data

### Business Benefits
Beyond regulatory compliance, SDTM provides:

- **Cross-study comparability**: Enabling meta-analyses and integrated summaries
- **Operational efficiency**: Reducing custom programming through standardization
- **Quality improvement**: Forcing systematic thinking about data relationships
- **Knowledge management**: Creating institutional memory through standardized processes

## The SDTM Domain Structure

### Core Principles
SDTM domains are built on fundamental principles:

- **One record per observation**: Each row represents a single data point
- **Standardized variables**: Using controlled terminology and naming conventions
- **Relational structure**: Linking related information across domains
- **Metadata documentation**: Comprehensive variable and value documentation

### Domain Categories

**Interventions Domains**: Exposure, Concomitant Medications, Substance Use
**Events Domains**: Adverse Events, Medical History, Clinical Events
**Findings Domains**: Laboratory Tests, Vital Signs, Physical Examinations
**Special Purpose Domains**: Demographics, Disposition, Protocol Deviations

## Mapping Demographics to SDTM

### Demographics Domain (DM) Creation

Starting with our demographics example, we examine:

**Raw Data Elements:**
- Subject identifier
- Date of birth
- Sex
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Study site information

**SDTM DM Domain Variables:**
- STUDYID, DOMAIN, USUBJID (identifier variables)
- AGE, AGEU, SEX, RACE, ETHNIC (demographic variables)
- SITEID, INVID, INVNAM (administrative variables)
- RFSTDTC, RFENDTC (reference dates)

### Mapping Process

1. **Variable mapping**: Aligning raw data fields to SDTM variables
2. **Value standardization**: Converting to controlled terminology
3. **Derivation logic**: Calculating derived variables (e.g., age from birth date)
4. **Quality checks**: Validating mapping accuracy and completeness

## Converting CRF Data to SDTM

### Data Transformation Steps

The conversion process involves systematic transformation:

1. **Data extraction**: Retrieving raw data from clinical databases
2. **Cleaning and validation**: Ensuring data quality and consistency
3. **Standardization**: Applying CDISC controlled terminology
4. **Domain assignment**: Organizing data into appropriate SDTM domains
5. **Relationship establishment**: Creating links between related domains
6. **Quality control**: Validating transformation accuracy

### Programming Considerations

Effective SDTM programming requires:

- **Robust derivation logic**: Handling missing data and edge cases
- **Audit trail maintenance**: Documenting all transformations
- **Version control**: Managing changes and updates
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient processing of large datasets

## Impact on Associated Documents

### Protocol Alignment
SDTM creation must align with protocol specifications:

- **Endpoint definitions**: Ensuring all protocol-defined endpoints are captured
- **Visit schedules**: Properly representing timing of assessments
- **Subject populations**: Accurately reflecting study participation

### Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Considerations
SDTM domains must support planned analyses:

- **Analysis populations**: Enabling derivation of analysis datasets
- **Endpoint calculations**: Providing necessary source data
- **Baseline definitions**: Supporting comparative analyses

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### SDTM Review Process

Comprehensive quality control includes:

- **Conformance testing**: Validating against CDISC specifications
- **Cross-domain consistency**: Ensuring relational integrity
- **Completeness checks**: Verifying all required data is included
- **Medical review**: Confirming clinical accuracy and relevance

### Documentation Requirements

Proper documentation includes:

- **Mapping specifications**: Detailed transformation rules
- **Derivation algorithms**: Step-by-step calculation methods
- **Assumption documentation**: Recording decisions and rationale
- **Change control**: Tracking modifications and their justification

## Best Practices for SDTM Creation

### Planning and Design
- Start SDTM planning during protocol development
- Engage cross-functional teams early in the process
- Consider downstream ADAM and TLF requirements
- Plan for submission-specific needs

### Implementation
- Use validated programming environments
- Implement comprehensive quality control procedures
- Maintain detailed audit trails
- Test with realistic data volumes

### Maintenance
- Establish change control procedures
- Document all decisions and rationale
- Plan for regulatory queries and amendments
- Prepare for potential re-submissions

The creation of high-quality SDTM domains is fundamental to successful regulatory submissions, requiring careful planning, systematic execution, and rigorous quality control throughout the process.
