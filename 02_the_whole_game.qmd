# The Whole Game

## Understanding the Entire Submission Process through an Example

This chapter provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire submission process by following a specific endpoint from its final presentation in a Table, Listing, or Figure (TLF) all the way back to its origin in the study protocol. This "whole game" approach helps readers understand how all components of regulatory submissions interconnect.

## Starting with a Table and Working Backwards: From Table to ADAM, SDTM, and CRF

We begin our journey with a completed demographic table from a regulatory submission and trace its data lineage backwards:

- **Table/Listing/Figure (TLF)**: The final output presented to regulators
- **ADAM Dataset**: The analysis-ready dataset used to generate the TLF
- **SDTM Dataset**: The standardized dataset derived from raw clinical data
- **Case Report Form (CRF)**: The data collection instrument
- **Protocol**: The source document defining what data to collect and why

This reverse engineering approach illuminates the critical dependencies and transformations that occur at each stage of the data pipeline.

## Exploring the Impact on Associated Documents

Understanding how changes at any level cascade through the entire system is crucial for:

- **Protocol amendments** and their downstream effects
- **Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)** modifications
- **Data management** considerations
- **Quality control** processes

## Roadmap of Key Outputs

By the end of this chapter, readers will understand:

1. The complete data flow from protocol to submission
2. How each document type serves a specific regulatory purpose
3. The interdependencies between different submission components
4. Quality control checkpoints throughout the process
5. The importance of traceability and documentation

This foundational understanding prepares readers for the detailed exploration of each component in subsequent chapters.
